		<h4>Purpos of video:</h4>
		<p>It was a guy reading a poem which was based on something that happened to him</p>
		<h4>How the video attempts to achieve its purpose:</h4>
		<p>The guy is sad about his uncle that commited suicide. So, he uses poetry to describe his feelings.</p>
		<h4>The structure of the message</h4>
		<p>It had an introduction at first. Then there was a discription. Then finally there was a conclusion</p>
		<h4>How this video helps my project</h4>
		<p>My essay should have an introduction, then a body describing what I am talking about. Then finally, there should be a conclusion to finish it off.</p>
