		<h4>How this video helps my project:</h4>

		<h1>Blog 2</h1>
		<H4>Targeted group in the video:</H4>
		<p>This video was targeted towards gamers</p>
		<h4>Social issue in the video:</h4>
		<p>The video shows how gamers have "no life"; basically saying they are wasting their time on video games insead of doing something meaningful</p>
		<h4>Video creator's view on issue:</h4>
		<p>The person who made this is showing how video games affect "hardcore" gamers. Some people will put so much time into a video game and it would consume that person. The ceator of the video shows this with humor style</p>
		
		<h1>Blog 3</h1>
		<p>The imagery of detroit in this commercial was a warm and a cheerful one. This was because they wanted to show a good environment to get a positive audience which is good for business. The voiceover sounds mature and wise, which again is to avoid negative audience. The tagline "imported from detroit", is to show the audience where to focus on and to strengthen the company's imagery.</p>
