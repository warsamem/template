	  <h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
	    
	    <p>This writing course has truly changed my perspective of writing. It has opened my eyes towards a wider view about writing in general. I learned the importance of writing in my major or whichever field I decide to major in the future. Before I took this course, I thought of it as just some random annoying course I have to go through just to get my degree. However, I now realize how gravely wrong I was. So now not only do I know the importance of this course, but also the attitude I should approach towards future courses. Besides writing, we also learned how to make websites and create our own blogs. This is one of the major reasons this class was awesome. Throughout several different assignments we learned different things about the writing “world” in general. I really needed this course considering I am a newbie in the field. I didn’t just learn more about writing in this course, I also realized how this course altered my sense towards technology. I learned more about videogames and how they affected throughout my life. I also learned how computers helped me reach this major.</p>
	    <p>In our first assignment we did the Lived Experiences Project. In this assignment, we had to write an essay on how a specific piece of technology has impacted our career life. Given how there is technology involved in every major career field around the world, I didn’t see how this couldn’t be a perfect first assignment. I talked about how computers helped me pick my computer engineering major. This helped me think more about computers and how I really feel about the bond I have with technology. In some ways this assignment kind of changed me as realized more about myself the more I wrote this assignment. This assignment felt like it was easy for students that majored in engineering fields. So, this was my favorite assignment. This assignment also helped me dig more into my past and realize how I actually liked computers and games at a younger age. It helped me realize how this major is very much what I desire. </p>  
	    <p>In the second assignment we did the Cultural Analysis Proposal. In this assignment, we had to talk about how a popular culture like a movie or videogame causes social issues for a group of people or us. Once we figured out what social issue and popular culture artifact we were going to talk about, then we had to come up with a solution for that specific issue. I talked about how a specific video game was a social issue for specific group of people. After this I talked about a solution to this problem. In this assignment, I learned how videogames could be harmful to me too. Videogames could waste a lot of your time and they could be addictive. I also talked about how important time is, and how we should all try our best not to waste our time because you might regret it one day. It cleared my head and showed the true colors of video games in one’s life. It was very enlightening assignment and it was much more difficult than the previous assignment; we had to research and citations which contributed to the main essay. I liked this assignment due to the fact that I was talking about one of my favorite things in the world, videogames.</p>
      <p>For our third essay, we did the Formal Research Project. This was the worst assignment for me. We had to talk about how writing affects our major or career field. Not only that, but we also had to do research specific articles. This just made things more difficult as the research was limited. We also had to interview people for this assignment which just made it more difficult for me. I am not the social type, so I didn’t enjoy the interview part. In some ways this felt like writing a book. We had to add a cover page and works cited page. It felt official like. This was also the longest assignment compared to the previous assignment, which just made things more difficult. Nevertheless, this assignment helped me learn something about writing. I learned more about how writing affects my major and how significant this course was for my degree. However, I wasn’t able to post the assignment due to a miscalculation on my part. Therefore I got zero credit for this assignment, which really messes up my final grade. I learned a major lesson from this assignment; to be more aware of the time and due dates of my future assignment. This caused a huge ripple throughout my final grade, but if I do well in my final assignment I would be in good hands.</p>	  
	    <p>For our fourth assignment we did Remix Project. This was completely different than all the other assignments we did till this assignment. We had to create a documentary. This meant we had to make video interviewing people. My group decided to do a video on games. This was due to the fact that we all enjoyed games on a daily basis. We all enjoyed games, so it was something that we all had in common. We interviewed a couple of people and finally finished our video. This assignment was pretty cool. Not only did we take a break from writing essays, but we had to work together in groups. We all depended on each other as a group, so everyone had to do their best to achieve a good grade. This was one of the downfall of the assignment. If someone decided to slack off, then all had to pay the price for it. So working together on this assignment was vital. This assignment actually helped as come together, so that we could also do the same for future assignments like this one. However, another difficulty was my teammates and their suffering towards English language. My teammates were from China, so this course was very difficult for them. Nevertheless, they tried their best and besides they were learning something from this whole thing. This assignment focused more on the video, so we didn’t have to worry about the paper that much. This helped a lot with the project. Teamwork was the only thing that could lead to a good grade for this assignment, so everyone had to pull their own weight.</p>
	    <p>For our final assignment, we are supposed to be doing the Course Retrospective Project. In this assignment, we write about how all the other assignments affected and how this writing course changed us. This is the last and I have to say the easiest assignment. For 30% of the project we have to work together to accomplish a good grade for the final assignment. The other 70% of the project is easy; we have to write a reflective essay on all the other previous assignments. It seems ironic that at this point I am writing the assignment. Since this is the last assignment, it is also the most important. So, getting a good grade in this is very important.</p>
      <p>There were other miniature project that we had to do for this course. We had to write blogs weekly and we had to also post our assignments as a web version. So, it was significant that we learned how to code HTML and CSS so that we could make websites. As a computer engineer student, this part wasn’t so hard for me; I already knew how to make websites. The only thing I had to worry about was the blogs, but they weren’t so hard either. In fact, I enjoyed writing a weekly blog about this course and how it impacted me. I have to say these two sections of the course were the best part; I had to learn how to code and write blogs. My favorite part of the class was this. Finally, we had to create a portfolio of everything we did so far. This assignment was pretty cool, considering it involved coding and the fact that I love coding.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this course has changed me a lot and has affected my point of view towards writing. I realized how important writing is to me now. It is a necessity that everyone should learn. I never thought of writing as something this important; I always thought of it as one of those annoying courses that they force to take in colleges or high schools. I now realized how wrong I was. I also learned more about how writing affects technology specifically my major. We also had to learn how to code, which could be very helpful. Even though some people might not care about websites, but knowing about it wouldn’t hurt; who knows when you will have to use it in the near future. I have to say this course was the best I have taken this semester. I never thought that a writing course would affect me this much.</p>
