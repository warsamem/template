			<p>There are many social issues in our lives. Some of these are confined into specific countries, like a specific culture. There are some that are worldwide, meaning they happen all around the world. These social issues are affected by a specific artifact. So, it is also important that you address this artifact when you are talking about the issue. Usually these social issues are focused more on specific audience that this affects more often. Usually this case is youngsters or younger generations, but that is not the case all the time. There is almost always solutions for these problems. It is just a matter of people actually doing something about their problems. There are outcomes to these solutions. </p>
