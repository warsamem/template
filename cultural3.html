			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>These days, people are more used to having fun indoors rather than inside. Younger people these days are more excited about watching the new episode of the Simpsons rather than go out and play physical games. This is not to say that they don’t play sports or play outside games, but it is less frequent to see kids excited for those sort of things. With the growing rate of technology these days, you can’t blame anybody for spending a lot of time on apps or watching new TV shows. It is one of the clichés in our modern life.</p>
			<p>Many people love watching TV, but there is a lot of love for video games as well. People play video games to break from this reality world and dive into a fantasy world where they can do whatever they want without getting judged or blamed for. For most people video games are a hoppy. Some people like reading or swimming, while others like video games. It is the time to relax and have fun with your friends whether it is killing other players in Call of Duty or getting a new loot in Borderlands. It feels fun and helps with the tension you are having. I personally enjoy playing video games. It helps me regain my focus when doing something complex. For instance, if I am doing a calculus problem, I would stop sometimes to play video games because it helps me focus. Other times I play it for fun especially on the weekends when I am bored.</p>
			<p>Most of these days there is a lot of options in almost anything. If you go to grocery store you have the choice of buying different types of food for your dog. People want different options; it makes you feel like you can get the right thing you wanted. So, you can only imagine video games having so many options. There are so many games that focus on different things to suit your best interests. One of those video games that has become very popular is World of Warcraft. This game has been very successful and there a lot of people playing it every day. At its highest point there were 12 million subscribers (Kain). The game has also made over $300 million (Parrish). There is large scale of people, since it is online and multiplayer game. People of all ages play this game.</p>
