			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Video games are good way to have fun, but like most fun things they have a negative side to them. They are time consuming. Duo to technology a lot of people waste their time by watching TV or playing video games. This usually applies to teenagers and kids, since they haven’t matured enough. Younger people tend to make a lot of mistakes, so you can understand when they waste their time watching too much TV. This doesn’t just apply to youngsters, there is the occasional adult that wastes their time instead of doing something valuable. You can’t really blame them since they are humans, and humans are vulnerable to mistakes. The bad thing is making the same mistake twice. You should have learned from your first mistake.</p>
			<p>Time is very important. Your whole life is like a clock. So wasting that time is not such a good idea. You have to know how to manage your time. Time management is very important, but most people don’t pay attention to it. There is nobody that has perfect time management. You will eventually run into an obstacle, that’s part of life. So, trying your best is important. Different people have different opinions about how to spend their time. Spending your time on valuable things like learning a new math problem is great, but you always need to take a break or else you might get headache or bored. So, taking a break is important. For some people this break is video games.</p>
			<p>One video game that is able to satisfy the cravings for a little fun time is World of Warcraft. Millions of people come together to have a little fun or break. This all fun and amazing, until some people decide to put in so much time into the game that it changes their life negatively. There are people that play so much that the sun barely touches the skin. Of course, not all people are like this. However, there is a lot of people that are like this. And this is not to blame on the developers of the game (Blizzard Entertainment), but rather the people that are senselessly wasting their time on the game. The people that have this problems are gamers, especially gamers that play a lot.</p>
