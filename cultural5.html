			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Wasting time is a mistake; and just like most mistakes these days, they can be learned from and avoided in the future. The last thing you would want is the same mistake repeated; avoid it like the plague. If you spend too much time on World of Warcraft, than you are spending the time of doing other important things like going to classes or doing laundry. This is a problem and there are multiple solutions to it. So many people that play World of Warcraft need some solutions for advice. </p>
			<p>You should try your best to control yourself. You shouldn’t let a video game take control of yourself. I don’t how hard it could be; it is not like cocaine or cigarettes. It is addictive, but not addictive enough that you will need to go to a rehab. If you can’t control yourself from a video game then you need to go see a doctor. You need to control and manage your time, and you will not face this problem of excessive gaming. If all else fails, there is always the option of quitting playing that game. This is very helpful if you have an issue with one specific game, say for instance World of Warcraft. If you have this problem with all other games, which I doubt very much, then you can stop playing them for good or your life will take a bad turn towards the inevitable bad consequences.</p>
