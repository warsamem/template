			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Solving this time issue, will prove to be very helpful if you decide to do something about it. If you learn how to manage your time properly, not only will you be able to accomplish great things in your life, but you will also feel like you are doing great things in your life. This doesn’t mean you stop playing video games, but rather you give them a specific time. Instead of spending more than necessary time on video games, you spend it on things you should spend it on. Everything you do takes up time, and since your life is a limited amount of time, you shouldn’t spend all of your time on a specific thing.</p>
			<p>I doubt anybody ever stopped completely playing video games because are so amazing. This is your life and you are the one that has the key to it. So, sometimes it is important that you things to the next level. If you addiction for video games is too much, then stopping playing them is an important level. You shouldn’t feel bad about this. There is plenty of other ways to have fun, as long you can manage them. For instance, you can consider playing soccer or basketball. What is important is that you were able to address your problems.</p>
