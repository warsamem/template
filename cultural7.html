			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In Conclusion, there is one lesson we learned here; time is money. Spending your time the right way is very crucial. Your time is divided into sections; each section is saved for specific activity. Some activities take more time than other activities. Spending your most time on specific section is not a good idea, as this would be unfair to the other sections. However, a lot of people tend to make this mistake a lot especially when playing video games. Video games are a fun way to blow steam, but can be addictive and unhealthy if you are not careful. So many people that play World of Warcraft face this issue and they should consider doing something about it. Most people don’t care about this and they regret later. Batter safe than sorry.</p>
			<p>There are multiple solutions to this problem. It depends how deeply affected you are by this problem. If you can manage yourself and are able to limit the time you spend on World of Warcraft, then you should consider doing this. This is what most people should be doing this. They know they are doing something wrong, but they don’t care. I feel bad for them, giving it is their life that’s going down the drain. Sometimes people get too addicted to video games that they should consider stopping playing video games. It is so ridiculous that some video game consumes that much. World of Warcraft is amongst the video games that causes these problems. This is not to say that World of Warcraft is terrible, in fact it amongst the best games out there. You just have to be very careful and don’t let it consume you.</p>
			<p>With the growing of technology, there are more and more ways to waste your time. So, being careful and mature is very vital. Teenagers are more likely to have this problem, but adults can also join the bandwagon. There are some smart teenagers that learn from their mistakes. These will be the ones that rule and change the world. These are the ones that have managed their time the right way.</p>
