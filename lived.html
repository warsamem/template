		<h1>Lived experiences project</h1>
		<p>When I first got my first video game, I fell in love with it. I put so much time into it, that my dad had to setup specific time for me to play in fear of getting too consumed. The first video game system I had was the PlayStation. When people asked me what you want to become when you grow up, I always replied: an engineer or a doctor. Those were the only two careers I knew back then. Most of the people in my country wanted to become either an engineer or a doctor for two reasons: to become rich and famous. I was really young and had no idea what either of them meant. I knew what doctors did from the few trips I took to the hospital. I thought all engineers built houses. I didn’t like them because at that time they sounded not interesting at all.</p>
		<p>As I grew up, I learned more and more.  I learned that there were tons of career paths you could take in your life. In my country, you usually take whatever career path your parents told you to. I was lucky enough to have cool parents that let me decide whatever I wanted to do. I still played video games, till I went to high school. It was boarding high school, which meant I was going to live away from my parents. So, my dad didn’t let me take a video game console because he wanted me to focus on my education. The good news was that I at least got my first laptop when I was in grade 11. This wasn’t the first time I have seen a computer or owned a computer. I had desktop that I shared with my siblings when I was younger. However, this was the first time I owned a laptop. I was so excited to have a laptop; it was like a dream come true.</p>
		<p>I fell in love with the laptop. At first I had no idea how computers were made or programmed. It was all alien to me. All I knew was that it somehow managed some electricity into something that I can interact with. I was really wowed by this. Now the first time I a piece of technology was when I was really young. I wondered how computers worked with other things like phones or printers. I thought they spoke in some sort of silent language. This is one of the reasons I loved computers; I always learned something new from them. So I decided to learn more into technology when I grow up. So, the next time people asked me what I wanted to become, I told them something to do with computers. I wanted to learn into this new alien world of computers.</p>
		<p>I had no idea what I exactly wanted to do in college. I knew I wanted to do something related to computers. I loved my computer class. I did so well in it, that my teacher told me to follow a career in computer science. I told him I would think about it. As the ending of my high school got close, I started applying to colleges. Michigan State University was the first to accept me, so I decided to come here. It was huge deal to me. I couldn’t believe I was going abroad to study. This is an opportunity of a life time to me. I realized I had lots of options when it came to choosing the major I wanted to do. </p>
		<p>I wanted to major in either computer engineering or computer science. Technology has affected me a lot. I don’t know how else to put: it makes me happy. It is ineffable. So one reason I wanted to do computer-related major was to help the world with my knowledge of technology. Technology has affected the world in a huge way. I mean we have improved so much thanks to technology. We can save millions of people from diseases thanks to technology. There is better security around the world. Sometimes it could be dangerous if you don’t use technology wisely. For instance, countries fighting can be more deadly because they have improved thanks to technology.</p>
		<p>Computer science focuses more on programming and building for computers, while computer engineering focuses on a mixture of programming and building of computers. So, I decided to do computer engineering because I wanted to do a mixture of both programming and building computers. Building computers is more fun to me, so that is why I decided to do it.</p>
		<p>Deciding what you want to do for a major in college is a big deal. Most people don’t chose something they like, so they end up with a messed up career. You have to choose something that you are passionate about or you are doomed. I wanted to major in something that I liked; something I will enjoy in the future. So, I wanted to become a video game developer because I wanted to make games. Games have impacted my choice of major when I was really young. I also wanted to build computers, so that’s why I decided to stick with computer engineering.</p>
		<p>So, my first video game console has impacted a huge part on my academic life. A lot people say that video games are a waste of time or useless. While I would agree with this 90% percent of the time, they are a fun way to take a break from something or enjoy yourself. As long as you know how to manage your time, it shouldn’t be a problem. People consider gamers to be nerdy or anti-social, but that is not true most of the time. I am not a nerd or anti-social, and yet I still play video games. It is just one of my hobbies; helps me survive through boredom.</p>
		<p>Now, being a computer engineer means putting in lots of energy and dedication. It can be frustrating sometimes. You could be writing a code and if you make a teeny tiny mistake, you’re screwed. So if you are not patient, then you’re in for a pain in the neck. However, if you are really excited and amused by this kind of stuff, then you are fine. You will feel good after you finish coding a program. You will be happy because you made something to be proud. It is like learning a new language. It is like going to a new country and learning about the people’s culture and language. So after you learn the new language, you will feel smarter or at least I would. Coding computers is just talking to the computer in its language.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, I am excited to know what computer engineering brings to my life. I want to help improve our world by making new technology. Video games are the number 1 reason I decided to do computer engineering. I just love playing games, so I want to make games. Another thing that interests me to do this major is technology. I just want to make a smart piece of technology that everybody would appreciate. That is my dream and hopefully it becomes true.</p>
